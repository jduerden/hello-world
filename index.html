  	<h1>My Knife Buying List</h1>
    <p>Let's start off with talking about something I'm interested in. Knives! To start, I think it would be cool to detail some of the cool knives I want to buy. For starters, I want to buy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gerber-StrongArm-Stainless-Compatible-Multi-Mount/dp/B00U0ILXGC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6F0X1XZ57F9D&keywords=gerber%2Bstrongarm&qid=1567885944&s=gateway&sprefix=gerber%2Bstrong%2Caps%2C200&sr=8-1&th=1" title="Gerber Strongarm on Amazon" Target="_void">This knife!</a> <strong>But I'm poor :(</strong></p>

    <p>This is me dreaming of all the outdoorsy stuff I could do with <em>that knife!</em></p>
